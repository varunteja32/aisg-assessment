### Development Note

During development, I utilized Claude AI as a programming assistant for code review, documentation help, and debugging suggestions. All design decisions, implementation logic, and problem-solving approaches reflect my understanding and skills. Claude helped streamline the development process while I directed the overall solution architecture and made all key technical decisions.
